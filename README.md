# 🥔 Potato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

A web application to detect **Potato Leaf Diseases** (Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It also visualizes model attention using **Grad-CAM Heatmaps**.

Built with **TensorFlow**, **Streamlit**, and **OpenCV**.
